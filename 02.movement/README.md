I tried adding some random circles and text, and gave the text different colors. This work shows everyone that different time periods have different days. Among them, there are many good days, but the things that happen on good days are random, and the degree of happiness they bring is also random. One of the biggest challenges here is how to make the circles appear randomly and correctly. However, generally speaking, as long as one is careful and serious enough, I believe a lot of useful things can be learned from this.

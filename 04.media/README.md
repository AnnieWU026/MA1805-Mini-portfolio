To make the last project interesting, I added quite a few new elements, including flickering and screen vibration. These elements, along with terrifying pictures and terrifying sound effects, might not make people so eager to open it, but I think it's a good attempt at a "prank", which includes a forest in the dark that's hard to see clearly. And an audio that plays and pauses by clicking the mouse. 

The biggest challenge lies in the flickering and the intervals between them as well as the range of vibration. However, if this could be further refined, it might be a great start for learning the code in media.

Also, uploading it correctly to github is quite a challenge

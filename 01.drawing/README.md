This is a children's painting with two sunflowers and two clouds. Although at first I wanted to try to design the same pattern as that famous painting. However, during the production process, I felt some difficulties. So, on the basis of simplicity, I retained the original appearance of the things, allowing them to express the painter's mood in a clear form, which included the passion of yellow and the melancholy of blue. The most challenging part of this picture lies in adjusting the position of the green part of the sunflower, but overall, it's a great experience for beginners.
